# Documentation

Every specification, deployment guide and driver internal, grouped by what you're trying to do.

## Start Here

- [Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md) — recommended setup order (servers → zones/scopes → subnets → addresses)
- [Windows Server Setup](deployment/WINDOWS.md) — WinRM, service accounts, firewall — Windows-side checklist for agentless DNS + DHCP

## Architecture & Design

- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) — system topology, component relationships, HA design
- [Deployment Topologies](deployment/TOPOLOGIES.md) — six reference production layouts with sizing notes
- [Data Model](DATA_MODEL.md) — database models, relationships, field definitions
- [API Conventions](API.md) — REST API conventions, pagination, error format
- [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) — coding standards, test requirements, CI
- [Observability](OBSERVABILITY.md) — logging, metrics, health dashboard
- [Permissions](PERMISSIONS.md) — RBAC grammar, builtin roles, scope delegation

## Feature Specs

- [IPAM](features/IPAM.md) — IP spaces, blocks, subnets, addresses, custom fields
- [DNS](features/DNS.md) — zones, records, views, server groups, blocking lists, Windows DNS (Path A + B)
- [DHCP](features/DHCP.md) — servers, scopes, pools, static assignments, leases, Windows DHCP (Path A)
- [Auth & Permissions](features/AUTH.md) — LDAP, OIDC, SAML, RADIUS, TACACS+, roles, API tokens
- [ACME DNS-01 Provider](features/ACME.md) — acme-dns-compatible surface for LE / public-CA cert issuance against SpatiumDDI-managed zones
- [Integrations](features/INTEGRATIONS.md) — read-only Kubernetes + Docker + Proxmox VE + Tailscale + Cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP) mirrors into IPAM; per-integration setup, mirror semantics, dashboard surface, roadmap
- [BGP Looking Glass](features/LOOKING_GLASS.md) — receive-only BGP collector (GoBGP) peering with the operator's routers; Sessions + Routes grid, RPKI status at ingest
- [Vertical network awareness](features/VERTICALS.md) — AV-over-IP (Dante / AES67 / SMPTE 2110) flow descriptors, BACnet/IP device-instance registry + BBMD conformity, Industrial-OT inventory + Purdue zoning, DICOM AE Title registry + peer map, and the fragile-device do-not-probe flag
- [System Admin](features/SYSTEM_ADMIN.md) — config, health dashboard, backup/restore

## Deployment

- [Docker Compose](deployment/DOCKER.md) — quick start, profiles, TLS, HA
- [Windows Server](deployment/WINDOWS.md) — connecting to Windows DNS / DHCP over WinRM + RFC 2136
- [Kubernetes](deployment/KUBERNETES.md) — umbrella Helm chart, HPA, Ingress / LoadBalancer, CloudNativePG + Redis Sentinel HA
- [Bare Metal](deployment/BAREMETAL.md) — Docker Compose on a host, Patroni HA Postgres overlay, OS appliance path
- [OS Appliance](deployment/APPLIANCE.md) — appliance image build
- [DNS Agent](deployment/DNS_AGENT.md) — agent protocol, auto-registration, config sync

## Driver Internals
