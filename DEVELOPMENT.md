# Development Guide

> Coding standards, the lint/test stack, the CI gate, the migration
> workflow, and the conventions every change must follow. Read
> [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) first for the high-level
> contribution flow; this doc is the detailed reference behind it.

The canonical spec for *what* the project is and *why* decisions were
made lives in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md). This guide covers *how* to
build, test, and ship changes.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Docker Engine 25+** and **Docker Compose v2.20+** — the backend, its
  tests, and the linters all run inside containers, so you don't need a
  local Python toolchain to contribute backend code.
- **Node 20+** (CI builds the frontend on **Node 22**) — only needed for
  the frontend dev loop and the frontend lint/build jobs, which run on
  the host.
- **Python 3.12** is the pinned interpreter version (`backend/pyproject.toml`
  → `target-version = "py312"`). You only need it on the host if you want
  to run the migration-shape linter or backend tooling outside Docker.

---

## 2. First-Time Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spatiumddi/spatiumddi.git
cd spatiumddi

# Create your environment file — at minimum change POSTGRES_PASSWORD and SECRET_KEY
cp .env.example .env
#   SECRET_KEY: openssl rand -hex 32
#   POSTGRES_PASSWORD: any non-default value

make build      # build all Docker images
make migrate    # apply Alembic migrations inside the api container
make up         # start the full stack (production images)
#   — or —
make dev        # start the dev stack with hot-reload (docker-compose.dev.yml)
```

The frontend is served on `http://localhost:8077` by default
(`HTTP_PORT` in `.env`; the container listens on port 80). See
[`deployment/DOCKER.md`](deployment/DOCKER.md) for the full port
reference and TLS setup.

**Default login:** `admin` / `admin`. On a non-demo install the seeded
admin carries `force_password_change=True`, so the first login redirects
to a password-change form (`backend/app/main.py` → `_seed_default_admin`).

To run the DNS and/or DHCP service containers alongside the control
plane, enable the matching Compose profiles:

```bash
COMPOSE_PROFILES=dns,dhcp make up
```

### Frontend-only dev loop

The fastest UI iteration loop runs Vite directly on the host (React 18 +
TypeScript + Vite) against the containerized API:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you get locked out of the admin account, see the password-reset
recipe in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md#development-commands) and
[`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

---

## 3. Coding Standards

### Backend (Python)

| Tool | Config | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ruff` | `[tool.ruff]` in `backend/pyproject.toml` | `line-length = 100`, `target-version = "py312"`. E501 is delegated to black. |
| `black` | `[tool.black]` | `line-length = 100`, `target-version = ["py312"]`. Black owns formatting; ruff owns lint rules. |
| `mypy` | `[tool.mypy]` | `python_version = "3.12"`, `strict = false` (default mode), `plugins = ["pydantic.mypy"]`. |

Run them via Docker so you get the exact pinned versions:

```bash
make lint          # backend (ruff + black + mypy) AND frontend (eslint + prettier)
make lint-backend  # backend only
```

> **Note:** the dev container ships whatever ruff/black/mypy versions
> were installed when the image was built, which can drift from the
> versions CI installs from `pyproject.toml`'s `[dev]` extra. If you have
> a host Python 3.12 with the `[dev]` extras installed, running ruff,
> black, and mypy on the host gives the closest match to the CI gate.

### Frontend (TypeScript)

| Tool | npm script | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `eslint` | `npm run lint` | Runs with `--max-warnings 0` — a warning fails the job. |
| `prettier` | `npm run format:check` | Use `npm run format` to auto-fix. |
| `tsc` | `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit`, no emit. |

```bash
make lint-frontend   # eslint + prettier check
```

## 4. The Absolute Non-Negotiables

These rules from [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md#absolute-non-negotiables)
apply to every change. They are reproduced here as a quick checklist;
the canonical wording lives in `CLAUDE.md`.

1. **API-first** — every UI action must also work via the REST API.
2. **Async throughout** — no synchronous DB or network calls in request
   handlers.
3. **Permissions enforced server-side** — the API validates authorization
   independently of the UI (see [`PERMISSIONS.md`](PERMISSIONS.md)).
4. **Audit everything** — every mutation is written to the append-only
   `audit_log` *before* the response is returned.
5. **Config caching on agents** — DHCP/DNS containers cache their
   last-known-good config locally and keep running if the control plane
   is unreachable.
6. **No hardcoded secrets** — credentials come from env vars or mounted
   secrets; secrets at rest are Fernet-encrypted.
7. **Structured logs always** — every log line is valid JSON with
   `timestamp`, `level`, `service`, `request_id`.
8. **Incremental DNS updates** — record changes use RFC 2136 DDNS or the
   driver API, never a full server restart.
9. **Idempotent tasks** — every Celery task must be safe to retry.
10. **Driver abstraction** — DHCP/DNS backend logic never leaks into the
    service layer (`backend/app/drivers/{dns,dhcp}/`).
11. **Multi-arch builds** — all Docker images support `linux/amd64` and
    `linux/arm64` (see §9).
12. **K8s manifests stay current** — when you add or change a service,
    update `k8s/base/` and `k8s/README.md`.
13. **MCP coverage for new features** — a new REST resource also gets
    matching Operator-Copilot MCP tools, with the default-enabled state
    an explicit decision per tool.
14. **Feature-module gating** — a new top-level resource family is
    evaluated for a togglable feature module (`app.services.feature_modules`).
15. **New integrations show up on the Dashboard** — wire a new
    read-only integration mirror into both the IPAM `IntegrationsPanel`
    and the dedicated Integrations dashboard tab.
16. **Per-role node-label gating** — a new top-level Helm workload gates
    scheduling on a per-role node label, not on a chart-render toggle.

When in doubt, read the full text and the surrounding "Cross-cutting
Patterns" section in `CLAUDE.md` before you start.

---

## 5. Tests

The backend test suite runs against a **real PostgreSQL instance** (not
mocks) so ORM and query issues surface early
(`backend/tests/conftest.py`).

```bash
make test                                  # full suite — pytest -n auto inside the api container
make test-one T=tests/test_health.py::test_liveness   # a single test, run serially
```

### Parallelism + per-worker databases

`make test` runs `python -m pytest -n auto` (pytest-xdist), one worker
per CPU. Each worker **carves its own throwaway database** off the same
Postgres instance — `spatiumddi_test_gw0`, `spatiumddi_test_gw1`, … — so
the session-scoped schema reset and per-test `TRUNCATE` can't step on
another worker's data. The non-xdist case (`pytest` with no `-n`) falls
back to the unsuffixed base database name.

`conftest.py` reads `TEST_DATABASE_URL` (default
`postgresql+asyncpg://spatiumddi:changeme@localhost:5432/spatiumddi_test`)
and rewrites `DATABASE_URL` to the per-worker URL **before** any `app.*`
import, so module-level engines and Celery `task_session` engines land in
the right database. `make test` runs inside the dev-compose `api`
container, which has `pytest` baked into its `build.target: dev` image and
`TEST_DATABASE_URL` pre-set against the dev Postgres service.

Because a single test doesn't benefit from xdist overhead, `make test-one`
runs serially (`-v`, no `-n`).

### What a new endpoint needs

Per [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md), every new API endpoint needs
tests covering the **success**, **unauthorized**, and **validation-error**
cases.

---

## 6. CI Parity — `make ci`

`make ci` runs the same lint/typecheck/build jobs GitHub Actions runs on
every push and pull request. Run it locally before pushing.

```bash
make ci
```

It chains three targets:

| `make` target | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `ci-backend-lint` | `ruff check app tests`, `black --check app tests`, `mypy app` (inside the api container; installs ruff/black/mypy on first run if missing) |
| `ci-frontend-lint` | `npm run lint && npm run format:check && npm run typecheck` |
| `ci-frontend-build` | `npm run build` |

`make ci` requires the dev stack to be running (the backend checks
execute inside the api container) and Node 20+ on the host. It does **not**
run the backend tests — use `make test` separately for those.

### The actual CI jobs

The CI workflow is [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml),
triggered on push to `main` and on every pull request:

| Job | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Backend — Lint & Type Check** (`backend-lint`) | `pip install -e ".[dev]"` on Python 3.12, then `ruff check`, `black --check`, `mypy app`, **plus the migration-shape linter** (`python3 scripts/lint_migrations.py` — see §8). |
| **Backend — Tests** (`backend-test`) | A required-check aggregator over four parallel `backend-test-shard` jobs. Each shard spins up `postgres:16-alpine` + `redis:8.8-alpine` services, runs `alembic upgrade head`, then `pytest -n auto --splits 4 --group N` (pytest-split selects the shard's slice; `-n auto` parallelizes it across the runner's vCPUs, each xdist worker on its own `spatiumddi_test_gw<N>` DB). The aggregator passes only if all four shards pass. |
| **Frontend — Lint & Type Check** (`frontend-lint`) | Node 22, `npm install`, then `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, `npm run typecheck`. |
| **Frontend — Build** (`frontend-build`) | Node 22, `npm install`, `npm run build`. |

Branch protection on `main` gates on these checks. `make ci` reproduces
the two lint jobs and the frontend build locally; `make test` reproduces
the backend test job (single-runner rather than sharded).

## 7. Repo Layout

A condensed map (full version in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md#repo-layout)):

```
backend/app/
  api/v1/        HTTP route handlers (ipam/, dns/, dhcp/, auth/, …)
  models/        SQLAlchemy 2.x async models
  services/      Business logic (dns/, dhcp/, dns_io/, ipam_io/, ai/)
  drivers/       DNS + DHCP backend abstraction + concrete impls
  tasks/         Celery tasks
  core/          permissions.py, crypto.py, auth/, audit, …
  config.py, db.py, main.py, celery_app.py
backend/alembic/ Migrations (tracked in git)
backend/tests/   pytest suite (conftest.py carves per-worker DBs)
frontend/src/
  pages/         Top-level routes
  components/     Shared UI; shadcn-style primitives under components/ui/
  lib/api.ts     API clients
agent/           Standalone DNS / DHCP agents + supervisor
charts/          Helm charts
k8s/             Kubernetes manifests
scripts/         lint_migrations.py, seed_demo.py, screenshots/, …
```

---

## 8. Migration Workflow

Models are SQLAlchemy 2.x async (`backend/app/models/`); schema changes
are versioned with Alembic in `backend/alembic/`.

```bash
# Generate a migration by autogenerating against the models
make migration MSG="add foo column"

# Apply pending migrations
make migrate
```

`make migration` runs `alembic revision --autogenerate` inside the api
container; review the generated file in `backend/alembic/versions/` —
autogenerate is a starting point, not a final answer.

### Conventions that bite if you miss them

- **Hand-written `create_table` for a `TimestampMixin` model** must set
  `server_default=text("now()")` on `created_at`/`modified_at`. Tests pass
  via `create_all`, but a fresh-install migration NULL-violates without it.
- **Verify the real Alembic head before setting `down_revision`.** A
  recently-dated file is not necessarily the head — run Alembic's
  `get_heads()` (or `alembic heads`); picking the wrong parent creates two
  heads and breaks CI.

### Expand/contract — the migration-shape linter

SpatiumDDI runs rolling N→N+1 upgrades across multiple control-plane
nodes, so during the mixed-version window the database is shared between
old (N-1) and new (N) application code. A destructive migration that
drops a column N-1 still reads will crash the old pods mid-upgrade.

The contract: **every migration must be safe against both N-1 and N
code** — expand in release N (add the new column/table/dual-write), drop
the old one in release N+1.

`scripts/lint_migrations.py` (stdlib-only, runs in the `backend-lint` CI
job) flags destructive ops (`drop_column` / `drop_table` in downgrades,
etc.) so they get the two-release treatment. Historical violations are
captured in a baseline file at
`backend/alembic/migrations_lint_baseline.txt`. If you intentionally add
a finding the linter should accept, regenerate the baseline and commit it:

```bash
python3 scripts/lint_migrations.py --baseline   # rewrite the baseline
python3 scripts/lint_migrations.py              # what CI runs (exit 1 on non-baselined findings)
python3 scripts/lint_migrations.py --show       # every finding, baselined or not
```

---

## 9. Multi-Arch Image Builds

Every Docker image must support **`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`**
(non-negotiable #11). The release pipeline
([`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml))
builds each image with `docker/setup-qemu-action` +
`docker/setup-buildx-action` and `platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64`.
Local `make build` produces single-arch images for your host — the
multi-arch fan-out happens in CI on a tagged release.

---

## 10. Branch & PR Conventions

- **Branch from `main`.** The project uses one branch per issue, named
  `issue-NNN` (keep every phase of a multi-phase change on the same
  branch). Squash-merge back to `main`.
- **Conventional-commit PR titles:** `<type>(<scope>): <short summary>`
  where `type` ∈ `feat, fix, docs, refactor, perf, test, build, ci,
  chore` and `scope` ∈ `ipam, dns, dhcp, auth, rbac, audit, ui, api, k8s,
  compose, agent-dns, agent-dhcp` (see
  [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](../.github/pull_request_template.md)).
- **Fill in the PR template** — Summary, Area, Test plan, and
  Migration/deployment notes. Don't leave them blank.
- **Link issues with the keyword per issue:**
  `Closes #123, Closes #456` — a comma-list like `Closes #123, #456` only
  closes the first.
- **Run `make ci` before pushing**, and `make test` for any
  behavioral change.

### Pre-PR checklist

- [ ] `make ci` passes (backend lint, frontend lint + typecheck, frontend build)
- [ ] `make test` passes (new/changed behavior is covered)
- [ ] Mutations write to `audit_log` before returning
- [ ] New endpoints have success / unauthorized / validation-error tests
- [ ] Alembic migration included if models changed (and it's expand/contract-safe)
- [ ] `k8s/base/` + `k8s/README.md` updated if a service or its env changed
- [ ] Matching MCP tools added for any new REST surface
- [ ] Third-party components added to the root `NOTICE` if you bundled any
